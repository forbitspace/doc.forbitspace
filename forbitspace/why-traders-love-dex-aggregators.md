# Why Traders Love DEX Aggregators?



DEX aggregators, also known as liquidity aggregators, have several benefits that have made them very popular among active traders. In fact, DEX aggregators have become so in vogue that they made up around 15-20% of decentralized trading volumes in mid-2020 - mid-2021. So let’s look at the benefits of liquidity aggregators.

1. DEX aggregators provide a deeper pool of liquidity for traders who want to trade large amounts of digital tokens.
2.  ou will typically receive a better execution price using a DEX aggregator than on a single DEX. Aggregators are built to enable traders to fill trades at the best possible level across a range of liquidity pools. So for price-sensitive traders and investors, it makes sense to use a liquidity aggregator instead of only a single decentralized trading platform.
3. n the same vein as “traditional” decentralized exchanges, DEX aggregators add a layer of privacy to crypto trading that you cannot find on centralized exchanges.
4. DEX aggregators are typically non-custodial exchange platforms, which means that traders always retain control over their funds.
5. iquidity aggregators improve the decentralized trading experience as they provide user-friendly dashboards where a few clicks suffice to trade millions in digital tokens within seconds.
