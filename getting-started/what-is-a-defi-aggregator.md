### What Is a DEX Aggregator?

Cryptocurrency exchanges are classified into two main types â€” centralized and decentralized. DEX aggregators serve as a unified explorer for prices and liquidity offered by decentralized exchanges \([DEXs](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-exchange-dex)\). With the rise in popularity of cryptocurrencies and the growing utilization of decentralized exchanges, DEX aggregators have become a sought-after service. 

Decentralized exchanges offer varying pricing, and it is not always easy to find the best deal for the trading pair you are looking into. Not only that, crypto investors are starting to turn more and more to DEXs, as they offer increased security and a better fit with the innate characteristics of a cryptocurrency. However, with the rising interest in crypto, more and more DEXs flood the market, and investors often struggle to find the best possible liquidity and pricing. This is where DEX aggregators come into play. While investors can try and sift through different exchanges with limited success, DEX aggregators rely on complicated algorithms to take into account numerous factors in selecting the best possible provider for a given token swap.
