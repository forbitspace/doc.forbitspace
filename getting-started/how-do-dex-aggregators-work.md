## How Do DEX Aggregators Work?

DEX aggregators source liquidity from different DEXs and thus offer users better token swap rates than they could get on any single DEX. DEX aggregators have the ability to optimize slippage, swap fees and token prices which, when done right, offer a better rate for users.

For instance, a swap deal split between several DEXs can get a user an overall better price than a swap on any single exchange.

A DEX aggregatorâ€™s main task is to offer a user better swap rates than any specific DEX can offer and to do that in the shortest possible time. Other major tasks are protecting users from price impact and reducing the probability of failed transactions.

DEXs are generally interested in DEX aggregator integrations, as they can attract more users and volume. Recent data shows that high notional traders are increasingly using DEX aggregators, while retail users still choose to access DEXs directly.

DEX Aggregators and the DeFi Boom DEX aggregators are a somewhat newer concept that arose from the rise in DEXs. They have become more important to users in the recent DeFi boom as more and more users prioritize better prices on their trades.
